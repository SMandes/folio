				<p>Hi there! I'm Steve Mandes, a Central New Jersey based Freelance Website Developer and Designer. I have been creating a web presence for business' and individuals alike for over 8 years. My keen approach toward creating an excellent user experience is what motivates me to achieve <a href="index.php" alt="Portfolio">high quality websites</a> for my clients. My philosophy is that websites should never look complicated or be difficult to navigate, but also convey the message they're trying to send.</p>


				<h2>Design Approach</h2>

				<p><strong>Simple, clean and responsive</strong> are the three key ingredients for my design approach. Having a website that is simple to navigate prevents prospect clients from leaving the website out of frustration. A <strong>clean design</strong> is what modern websites these days call for, free of clutter and bloat that can create serious slow downs when visiting. Lastly, a <strong>responsive website</strong> for SEO purposes and to reach over <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" alt="Smart Insights">1.8 billion users worldwide</a> who use their mobile devices to browse the web. As of 2014, the number of people that use mobile devices as a primary source for browsing the web has exceeded those who browse using a desktop. Keeping up to date with design trends and putting them into practice is what will make a website stand out from the rest.</p>
