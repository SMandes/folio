				<h2>Skyhigh Website</h2>

				<p>Skyhigh is a digital agency concept that was originally designed for a future agency I would eventually create for myself. The entire site is responsive and works well across all screen sizes. I implented subtle hover effects and a parallax design when scrolling to give a pleasing user experience.</p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
				
                <p>The Skyhigh website used the Front-end Framework, Bootstrap, to rapidly develop a simple and responsive site. Add in other CSS libraries for amazing effects and a parallax scrolling for an amazing user experience.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Software: Brackets, Photoshop <br/>Languages: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript/JQuery</strong></p>
