				<h2>Lean an Green Website</h2>

				<p>Lean an Green is a health coaching company that provides health, fitness, diet programs and information to their clients. They operate under the umbrella 'Take Shape for Life', a company similar to 'Weight Watchers', but instead have an option to become a health coach and sell their products.</p>

				<h3>The Project</h3>

				<p>One of the health coaches from 'Take Shape for Life' came to me and asked if he could have a landing page created with information about what he offers and provide direct links to his affilate with 'Take Shape for Life'. He essentially wanted to create a primary location that will guide his clients to the correct affilate page.</p>
                
                <h3>Design</h3>

                <p>The client needed a logo created that would correlate with the products he was selling. Thus the name and the logo, 'Lean an Green', was born. Putting into consideration that 2015 is the year of handwritten design trends, I decided to come up with a handwritten typgraphic logo that would be modern and easy to read. Following 2014's trend of full screen background's, the landing page used influences from many modern sites displayed on <a href="http://www.webcreme.com" alt="Web Creme">web creme</a>. <strong>Software: Balsamiq, Photoshop</strong></p>
                
                <h3>Development</h3>

				
                <p>The Lean an Green website used the Front-end Framework, Bootstrap to rapidly develop a simple and responsive user experience. <strong>Software: Brackets | Languages: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/JQuery, PHP</strong></p>
