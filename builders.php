				<h2>Builders Design</h2>

				<p>Builders is a construction company website design concept I put together for a close friend. Most inspiration was drawn from my time working in Hoboken and near the NYC area where construction on buildings is consistently on going. I took certain elements from those constructions sites and implemented them in to the sites design.</p>

				<h3>The Project</h3>

				<p>The project was designed in Photoshop CS6 and utilized the 960 Grid System as a base. The goal was to align all elements correctly for when it comes down to the development phase.</p>
