				<h2>Colors Galore</h2>
					<p>Colors Galore is an art studio website concept I put together. Inspiration was drawn from visiting the botanical gardens over the summer. I took certain elements from my visit there and implemented them in to the sites design.</p>
                
                <h3>Design</h3>
                	<p>The project was designed in Photoshop CS6 and utilized the 960 Grid System as a base. The goal was to align all elements correctly for when it comes down to the development phase.</p>
