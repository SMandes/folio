							<h2>A little bit about me</h2>

							<p>Born and raised in Staten Island New York, my entire childhood I was always consider a heavyset. Teased by classmates, family and friends
		I was sick and tired of looking the way I did, so I decided to make a change and was determined to do so. I still continue to improve my 
		physique to this very day. </p>

							<p>After much thorough research on nutrition and experimenting with my own body I was able to see change and results, you can say I became addicted.
		Many say I am blessed because of my genetics, but that’s just a poor excuse. I don’t have easy muscle building genetics, eveything I have
		achieved is because of strict dieting and a rigourous workout routine that works best for me. I want to share my knowledge and find
								a diet and workout routine that works best for you to help you achieve your goals today! <a href="plans.html" alt="Aesthetics Nutrition Plans and Packages">Let’s get it!</a></p>

				  </div><!--/.col -->
				  
				  <div class="col-md-7 wow fadeInRight">
					  <p>Over the years, after helping numerous people as a personal trainer, I slowly 
began to realize that  training and working out played a very small part in the 
fatloss process. Only the clients that were following a guideline of what I gave 
them to eat were making progress and the clients who I didn't monitor their 
eating plan were not reaching their goals at the rate they wanted to probably 
due to eating a horrible diet. This is when I realized I wanted to focus more on 
the nutrition aspect and helping people eat the correct diet based on their 
bodytype and goals. 
</p>
					  <p>I started Aesthetics Nutrition because all these fad diets that are out in the 
mainstream media are cookie cutter outlines where 1 diet fits all; when losing 
fat and building muscle is a very individual process and not that simple. Those 
fad diets will help you lose total weight (water, muscle, bone density) they will 
not help you solely lose "fat" while maintaining and building muscle which should 
be the ultimate goal. Everyones diet along with training should be customized 
and monitored based on individual needs and bodytypes. This is why I started 
Aesthetics Nutrition to help coach and guide people step by step to reaching their 
goals and looking like the best version of themselves.</p>
