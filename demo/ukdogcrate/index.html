				<div class="about-section">
					<p><strong>Dog crates</strong> have become very popular now in the UK as they have some real advantages for you and your dog. Keeping your pet safe when unsupervised, keeping your property safe from being chewed or preventing your carpets being soiled. Dogs don't feel that they are being caged they feel protected inside a dog crate and for the benefit of your dog please take a little time to learn a little more about a dog or puppy's behaviour with regard to a den. </p>
					
					<p>Have a look at our dog crates guide for full information and advantages of using our dog crates.</p>
					
					<p>Our <strong>dog crates</strong> are of a professional high quality with an innovative design that allow simple assembly and disassembly in seconds. It's easy erect one of our dog crates and when not in use, they fold flat for easy storage and transportation. We use high quality heavy gauge metal so they are tough and durable. Available in five sizes to accommodate almost all breeds and even some other pets. They have fully galvanised metal tray which, unlike plastic will not crack, warp and cannot be chewed and won't rust. Cages with plastic base trays are cheaper because metal is and expensive commodity these days. Fact is if a base can be chewed there is a danger to a dog. It's not often that you buy a dog crate so when you do you want good value for money, something that will last you for years. We don't believe you will find the same quality at these prices anywhere else. They are used by professional dog show experts but you don't need to be a professional or an expert to have the best quality at the lowest prices. Please take a look at the information page which may give you more help and info on our dog crates cages and their uses.</p>

				<p class="center-txt"><strong>Q. Why can some companies offer you free delivery over a certain price.<br><br>

					A. The metal we use for our crates is a higher grade metal which means it is more expensive for us to buy. However, we have far fewer complaints about the quality of our dog crates.  If we were buying our crates at a lower price we would probably be offering a lower quality of product but we could offer free delivery because the profit margin is much higher. We believe when you compare like for like we have the best value because we think our crates last that much longer and therefore stretch your pound value much further.</strong></p>

				<p class="center-txt red-font">Our Dog Crates are designed for House Training pets and NOT designed to contain aggressive

				house when alone, you will need to train them BEFORE leaving them in one of our cages on their own.
				If you fail to train them before leaving them your pet could damage
