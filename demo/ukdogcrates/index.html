                    <p><strong>Dog Crates Puppy Cages</strong><br> So you are looking for a dog crate and you want the highest quality you can find for the lowest possible price. Dog Crates offer you an effective way to house train puppies or keep your Dog safe and secure when in or away from home. We think you will be pleasantly surprised the by our quality and prices. Let us first get rid of some myths about dog crates and make a few comparisons to the other quality dog crates that are available to you. Let's first look at the black epoxy coated crates. We do not offer these because they chip so easily and look tatty after only a few uses and lets be honest if you are spending good money then you will want real value for your money and not something that is going look tatty within a short period of time. Now let's look at those plastic bases that some companies put in the crates. Plastic bases often crack, and split and as well as this dogs often chew them so in reality I can see no advantage to a plastic base except for possibly saving the manufacturer a little money on material and labour costs? This is why we say there are more disadvantages to plastic bases. </p>
					
					<img src="img/qualityapp.jpg" alt="">
					
                    <p><strong>Focusing on the advantages and of our dog crates and getting value for money.</strong><br>Let us move onto chrome - they look great at first and then you find they also chip and flake because chrome is just another coating. We found that the flaking chrome if ingested by a dog could make them unwell. In fact you don't really see many chrome ones around these days which I think is a good thing. So what are you left with? Well you are left with what we sell which is galvanised dog crates but we have improved on them over our years of working within the industry. We have increased the gauge of the mesh frame to 9mm so that it is stronger than others. Even if our competitors can stand on their crates (So can we) but please realise that they are not designed for this and ours are perfectly designed for the task they are meant to be designed for which is dog or puppy training and light containment. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Only the Best - And Our Guarantee To Back It Up</strong><br>
We do not offer economy models, the reason why they are less expensive than others is because we are not greedy and profiteering and the result is that we sell more crates. Remember that quality materials and components do cost more. The metal base tray in our dog crates is far more expensive in material cost than a cheap plastic base tray but for obvious reasons we only provide the metal base trays.</p>

                <p>The <strong>dog crates</strong> have been designed to be light enough to be portable but tough enough to last. </p>
				
				<p>We believe our metal base trays are better because plastic base trays get chewed or can crack and splinter. Plastic is cheaper but you get what you pay for and your puppy or dog relies on your judgment for its security and wellbeing. </p>
				
				<p>Because we use an indestructible metal tray it enables us to maintain a lower overall weight by using less wire on the base as the metal tray ensures that the bottom cannot be used as an escape route. Heavier does not mean better or stronger. But lighter does mean easier to carry. </p>
